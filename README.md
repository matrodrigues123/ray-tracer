# Rust Ray Tracer

This is a project implementing a ray tracer in the Rust programming language, inspired by the book ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), by Peter Shirley. 

## Project Description

This project aims to provide a simple, yet effective, ray tracing program. Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.

The program is written in Rust, a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
